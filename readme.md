TaskLists
===============
 TaskLists is designed for one purpose, storing links, in you're google tasks, to allow link saving across platform, without another account.
 **Having a google account is _required_** and also, come on, if you're using chrome in the first place, i hope you sync with your google account.
 This extension is **written entirely in javascript**.
 
 To use it, checkout [The Examples](https://github.com/b3ngr33ni3r/TaskLinks/tree/master/examples) and work from there, or **just install the extension and figure it out** that's how i roll.
 However, if you do find yourself needing help, [shoot me a tweet](http://twitter.com/b3ngr33ni3r) and i'll try and respond asap.
